## My Assumptions

I have several assumptions as the instructor:
- You give me and the class your full effort. 
- You attend class regularly. 
- You come to class to learn, do your homework to solidify your understanding, and do the projects to cap off the units.
- You are communicative with me, my staff, and your peers. If you don't understand something, it is ok - that just means we need to spend time on it!

In turn, you can assume from myself and my staff:
- That we will be dedicated to your learning!
- That we will make sure that class is a positive and enjoyable experience, even when it is stressful or intense. 
- That we will be patient, understanding, and firm in turn to make sure you eek out every little bit of value and knowledge from this course. 
- That we want you to succeed, more than anything else!
- That we want you to feel confident, skilled, and excited coming out of this class!

I love this journey with my students and staff, both! I want all of you to succeed, so much. I have high expectations but I will help each and every one of you make it because I know you can. 

I highly recommend you do the following: 
- Attend office hours as much as you can.
- Arrive early to class
- Minimize absences
- Start each homework immediately upon assignment. 
- Ask for further out-of-class learning, to solidify weak areas and polish strong ones. 

## Format and Procedures

### Class

- Before class and after class, there are office hours to be used at the student's discretion. 
    - Staff will be on hand to help with questions, homework, projects, further learning, etc.
    - Students can schedule time with a TA for one-on-one time or regarding homework grades
    - Supplementary/remedial lectures and/or whiteboarding practice may be offered as well during the semester
- Class beings at 6:30 pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 10:00 am on Saturday.
    - It is STRONGLY encouraged that late attendance be kept to a minimum. Class immediately begins at the stated time. 
    - Students are responsible for marking their own attendance in bootcampspot. Failure to do so may be counted as an absence. 
- Class consists of a combination of the following: 
    - Lecture on technical concepts
    - Demonstration of concepts, practical coding, and technology. 
    - In-class activties, with the students, either solo or in-group as directed, completing a specific task or tasks with a review at the end
- Class proceeds until 9:30 pm on Tuesday and Thursday, and 2:00 pm on Saturday
    - There is a 15 minute break taken at the Instructor's discretion on Tuesday and Thursday, usually in the window of 8:00pm to 8:30pm.
    - There is a 40-45 minute lunch break on Saturday, directed at the Instructor's discretion, usually at noon. 

### Homework

- Homework is submitted as-is on the date it is due. 
    - Waiting to turn in something until finished is detrimental to learning, as the point of the homework is to evaluate learning up to that point.
    - Given that, please turn in homework on time, so that the staff can help you with anything you missed. Waiting until the last few weeks of class to do all the homework will harm you, not help you.
    - Early submission of the deployment and repo will allow for the student to continue working up until the deadline (This is really helpful!)
- Homework submissions consist of two things:
    - The repository containing the actual source code for the homework.
    - The deployed version of the homework, whether through Heroku or GitHub Pages
    - Homework is incomplete without both of the above. Failure to turn in both will be corrected at first, but continued failure to provide both will result in grade penalties. 
- Homework is your own work. 
    - This doesn't mean you can't use help, nor Stack Overflow, nor tutoring or anything else. 
    - The goal of the homework is to teach you patterns, reinforce learning, and strengthen your skill as a developer. Not doing your own work means you get none of the above, cheating yourself. 
- Homework is 50% of the learning! Please make sure to give it all your attention and effort. 
- You can ask your peers for assistance, the staff for assistance, or even tutors. Don't get stuck and then don't say anything!

### Projects

- Projects are capstones to units, and are as such, super important. 
- Projects are tremendous amounts of work! 
- Groups will be assigned at the instructor's discretion, with feedback accepted from the students.
- Prior to groups for a project being formed, the Instructional Staff invites any concerns regarding placement, to make sure every student is comfortable. 
- Each student must submit a link to the deployed version of the group project and a link to the group repository. 

### Concerns
Academic concerns can be addressed through the Instructional Staff and the SSM. 

Policy concerns can be addressed through the SSM and University Representative. 

Non-Academic concerns, such as harassment or discrimination can be brought up through any of the above, depending on the case and student's comfort. There is no chain of command to go through; should a student have any situation they deem uncomfortable, they are free to escalate to the SSM, U of A rep, or the Instructor as they feel needed. 
 
## Academic Integrity
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the [University of Arizona Code of Academic Integrity](https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies/code-academic-integrity). Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic grading  will be the student's own work. 

You are however encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the homework with other students.

Snippets of code used should be cited with a commented out link to the source. This is to make sure that if something is wrong with it, or you need further explanation, we (and you!) can easily find it again. (This is industry practice, frequently)

One great way to assess what you know is to teach ideas to a peer! You are more than welcome to give help or receive help from peers. However, your work should still be your own work; copy and pasting your peer's entire application is not ok. 

Should unauthorized and uncited copying occur, penalties will be applied. 

## Nondisrcrimination and Harassment

Reproduced from [here.](https://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy)

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination. In support of this commitment, the University prohibits discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information. All members of the University community are responsible for participating in creating a campus environment free from all forms of prohibited discrimination and for cooperating with University officials who investigate allegations of policy violations.
