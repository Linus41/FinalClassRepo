# Mongo

In this activity, we will add on Mongoose to our server.

## Instructions.

* Install `mongoose`

* Set up a connection with mongoose to a local database; But with the option to take in process.env.MONGODB_URI first.

* HINT: Look back at Thursday

* Make sure you have `mongod` running in another terminal

* Run `npm run start` - this should start your server! If it doesn't, start debugging
