# Web App Manifest

In this activity, you will write your first progressive web application manifest.

## Instructions

* Using the instructor demo as a guide, create a manifest for the Image Gallery app.

  * 🤔 Where do you create the `manifest.webmanifest` in the application architecture?

  * 🤔 How do you deploy a manifest? Hint: You will need to somehow link it with the web page. (See [Web App Manifest - Deploying a manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest#Deploying_a_manifest_with_the_link_tag).)

* When finished, run the commands:

  * `npm install`

  * `npm run seed`

  * `npm start`

* Navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and open `DevTools > Application > Manifest` to verify successful loading of the manifest.

## 💡 Hint(s)

Read the [MDN Web App Manifest documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) 

## 🏆 Bonus
