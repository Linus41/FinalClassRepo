# Image Compression

In this activity you are going to use an online compression tool to decrease image file sizes for the Gallery App.

## Instructions

* In this activity you will be using [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress images.

* First, unzip the `uncompressedImages.zip` file.

* Next, navigate to [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/).

  * Tiny PNG is an example of a free image compression tool. There are a number of good free and paid applications that run on the web and some that you can download to run natively on the computer. Paid tools will generally offer many more configuration options and handle larger files.

* Follow the instructions to upload 3 to 5 images to Tiny PNG. The app will begin compressing the images.

* Click `Download all` once the hap has finished compressing all of the images you uploaded. This will download a `zip` file containing the optimized images. The `zip` fill will most likely be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder.
