# Minify Your JS

In this activity you will minify your JavaScript using an online tool.

## Instructions

* Using the project you audited previously, navigate to [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/)

* Copy the contents of one of your JS files into the compressor and click on the `Compress JavaScript` button.

  * If you see an error, try checking the box labeled `ECMAScript 2019 (via babel-minify)` before trying again.

* Note the resulting Input/Output sizes of the JS as shown to the bottom of the textarea.

* Create a `dist` folder in the root of your project.

  * Create an `index.js` file inside of your `dist` folder.

  * Copy/paste the minified JS of your dist folder into your `dist/index.js`

* Be sure to link your `dist/index.js` code to your application.
