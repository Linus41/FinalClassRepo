# Populate

## Instructions

* Open `server.js` and update the `/populate` route to return `Users` populated with notes as JSON to the client.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Check out the `Note.js` and `User.js` models to see how the schemas there make the populate method possible.

## 🏆 Bonus

* Insert five more documents with one command. Use [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) to see how you can accomplish this.
