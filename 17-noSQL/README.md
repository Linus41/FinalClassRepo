# Unit 17: NoSQL

## Overview
In the late 90s and early 2000s, developers began to explore database options that allowed their web applications to handle unstructured data to meet the growing and ever-changing demands of users and address the limitations of the relational model. While these alternative databases existed for decades prior, they didnâ€™t receive the label NoSQL until this time period.  

The structure of a NoSQL database is something other than a table. There are several different types of NoSQL databases, such as key-value and graph. In this unit we will learn MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB documents correspond to a row, or record, in SQL, but unlike rows, documents are analogous to JSON objects. You can see why MongoDB is a popular choice for Node.js developers! 

Rather than object-relational mapping, we will implement object-_document_ mapping, or ODM, with Mongoose.js. 

## Key Topics
* NoSQL
* MongoDB
* Object-document mapping
* Mongoose.js
* CRUD

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?
2. What is object-document mapping? 
3. What is the equivalent of Sequelize associations in Mongoose.js? 

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL
* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB
* Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB, using both the  and Mongoose.js
* Use both a GUI and the Mongo command prompt to interface with a database
* Integrate Mongoose in a full-stack web application
* Create query builders to populate documents using refs

## Homework: Workout Tracker
Create and deploy full-stack workout tracker application. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
