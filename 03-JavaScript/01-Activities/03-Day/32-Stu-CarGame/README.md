### Instructions

* Using the unsolved code as a starting point, create a complete application that meets the following specifications:

  * Users can enter keyboard input (letters).

  * Each of the car's methods are assigned to a key.

  * When the user presses a key, it calls the appropriate function.

  * These letters also trigger a global function called `reWriteStats()` that logs the car's make, model, color, mileage, and `isWorking` status to the console.

* **HINT:** A "while loop" is already set up for you that will continue to ask the user for input as long as they don't press Cancel. Your logic will go inside this loop.

* **BONUS:** Prevent the user from being able to drive the car if it needs a tune-up.
