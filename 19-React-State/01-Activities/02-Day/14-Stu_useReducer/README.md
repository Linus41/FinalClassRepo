In this activity we will practice using the `useReducer` Hook.

  # Instructions

  * Replace your React application's src folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src).

  * Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

  * Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and study the rendered application.

  * Update this application to accomplish the following:

  * Create a `useReducer` Hook that checks for two different cases (one for each dog).

  * The second argument in `useReducer` should be an object with two properties.

  * Each case should return a _new_ state object with the updated properties. 

  * Add the necessary code to display the number of praises that each dog has.

  * When a dog is praised, an action should be dispatched that contains an identifier so that the correct dog's praises can be updated.
