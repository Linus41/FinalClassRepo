In this activity we will practice using the useState and useEffect Hooks in React by transforming a stateful class component into a functional component with React Hooks.

# Instructions

* Replace your React application's src folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src).

* If you created a new React app, you will need to install axios and React Router.

* Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

* Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and study the rendered application.

* Update this application to accomplish the following:

* In `pages/Search/index.js`, Create a functional component in place of the class component.

* Replace `this.state` and all instances of `this.setState` using the `useState` Hook.

* Replace all component lifecycle methods with their Hook counterparts.

* Remove the search button and utilize the `useEffect` Hook to query every time the user inputs anything into the search bar.
