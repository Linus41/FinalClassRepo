# HotRestaurant FULL STACK

* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery... PLUS MYSQL. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list. If a user clicks on the 'remove' button on a table or waitlist, the reservation is removed.


## Instructions

* Let's go Full Stack!

* First, we need to create a DELETE route in our API Routes

* Then, we need to create a button that generates when the waitlist or tables are displayed.

* When that button is clicked, hit the DELETE route and refresh the page!

## Notes

* Now we are doing some front end stuff! We will need to change the tables.html, along with our routes! (By creating one!)

## Bonus

* Add a PUT route, to let us seat a customer from the waitlist. We will need a new button and a new route!

## Good luck! Don't stress out

* Spend some time trying to build exposure. But don't get overwhelmed. We'll have plenty of time to come back to this!
