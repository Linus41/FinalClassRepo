# HotRestaurant Bonus

* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery... PLUS MYSQL. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list. If a user clicks on the 'remove' button on a table or waitlist, the reservation is removed.


## Instructions

* Let's add some cool things!

* BONUS: Add a route/front end component that lets us edit a current table!

* BONUS: Can we make customers separate from tables? That is, can we make a customer table and a tables table, to better track this? We will need something called a many-to-many relationship here, a relationship table called reservation!

* BONUS: Add some validation, both on the front end, and the backend for making a reservation.

    - Phone Number needs to be a phone number
    - Email needs to be an email (HARD!)
    - Name can't be blank!
