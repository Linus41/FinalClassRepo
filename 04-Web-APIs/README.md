# Unit 04: Web APIs

## Overview
Built in to every browser are methods and properties that allow us to extend its basic functionality using JavaScript. This is an example of an application programming interface, or API. APIs are central to creating dynamic, interactive web applications. The first, and perhaps most important, API we will work with is the Web API, which interfaces with the browser. 

In the previous unit, you worked with the `Window` object to generate alerts and prompts in the browser. If you inspect the `Window` object in your developer tools, you'll see that it contains many properties and methods in addition to the ones you’re familiar with. The `Window` object is only one of dozens of interfaces we can access in the Web API, so you can probably imagine the functionality available to us if we've only seen the tip of the iceberg so far!  

We will look at a few of the most important Web APIs in this unit, beginning with the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is an in-memory object-oriented representation of an HTML document, which allows us to interact with HTML using JavaScript. When we interface with the DOM, we are not making any changes to the HTML document itself—only to its representation as an object in the browser. DOM methods allow us to select elements to get content from them or insert content into them, generate new elements, and listen for and respond to events such as key presses and mouse clicks.


## Key Topics
The following topics will be covered in this unit:
* Web APIs and interfaces
* Timers
* Document Object Model (DOM)
* Getting, selecting, traversing, and manipulating elements
* Form events
* Keyboard and mouse events
* Bubbling and propagation
* Event delegation


## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is the DOM API?
2. What is event delegation?
3. What is the purpose of client-side storage?


## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Explain and identify the document object and its relationship to HTML.
* Use the `Window` object for local and session storage.
* Explain event propagation and implement handling functions.
* Use DOM API methods to select and dynamically generate HTML elements and content.
* Use DOM API methods to handle events such as key presses and mouse clicks.
* Research Web API documentation to implement new and unfamiliar interfaces.


## Homework: Code Quiz
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment. These assessments are typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a code quiz of multiple-choice questions.
