# Listening For Other Events

## Instructions

* In this activity, we are going to create a webpage that will allow us to view some meta data about different kinds of events.

* Open the `index.html` file in your browser and take a moment to study the application.

* Take a moment to study the code in `index.html` then add the following functionality to the application:

  1. The select element should trigger the `toggleDisplay` function in `script.js`.

  2. If `key` is selected, the event's code, key, and status (keydown or keyup) should be displayed in the `#key-events` div when the user presses a key anywhere on the document.

  3. If `click` is selected, the text content of the event's target, and the cursor's x and y coordinates should be displayed in the `#click-events` div when the user clicks the anywhere on document.

## Assistance

Only unsolved this time!

## Bonus

* If time permits, take a moment to research some other JavaScript events.
