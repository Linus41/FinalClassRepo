# Preventing Default Events

In this activity, we are going to create a form that calculates a suggested tip amount based off of the total of the bill.

## Instructions

* In a file called `index.html`, create a form with the following elements *INSIDE THE FORM*:

1. An input for the total price of the meal

2. An input for the tip percentage

3. A button to calculate the tip

* In a file called `script.js`, create an event listener that utilizes the values from the input fields to calculate the recommended tip and the new total of the bill with tip included.

* Once these values are calculated, display them on the page.

## Bonus 

* Add a feature that gives users the option to evenly split the total between any number of people. Make sure to add code to ensure that the split total will be rounded to two decimal places. 

## Hint

* In JavaScript, we have a function that rounds a number to a given point called `toFixed()`.
