# Event Delegation

## Instructions

* In this activity, we are going to create a friends list that allows us to edit information about that friend in a modal.

* Take a moment to study the code in `index.html`. You will not need to add any additional code to this file. Additionally, all of the CSS has been provided.

* In `script.js`, add support the following features: 

  1. When the `Add Person` button is clicked, the person should be added to both the people array and the list elements.

  2. If `edit` is clicked, event delegation should be used to handle the click event.

  3. When the user clicks on edit, the modal should appear with the modal header property already populated with the person's name. If a description exists, the textarea should be populated with the person's description. If not, the description should be left blank.

  4. When the `save` button is clicked, the description of the current person should be updated in the people array.

* **Bonus**: Use event delegation to make the modal close if the user clicks away from the modal.
