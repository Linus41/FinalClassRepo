# Render Todos

In this activity you will be writing code to render an array of todo items to the list.

## Instructions

* Open the `script.js` file provided to you. You have been provided the necessary variable declarations as well as an array of todo items.

* Your goal is to create a function that will render our todos into a list in the browser.

  * Initially set the text content of the todoList to an empty string.
  
  * todoCountSpan should show the total count of todos on the page.
  
* Inside of your render function you will also need a for loop.

  * It should loop over the `todos` array creating an `li` element for each index of the array.
  
  * It should set the content of the created `li` element to the value of the current array index.
  
  * Finally the new `li` should be appended to the `ul` provided.
