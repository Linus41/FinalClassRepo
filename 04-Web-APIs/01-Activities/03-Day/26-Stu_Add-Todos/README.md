# Add ToDo's

In this activity, we will be continuing to build on our Todo activity. This time, we'll be adding the `add` functionality.

## Instructions

* Add an event listener so that when a user hits enter, the value from the todo input field is pushed to our todo array.

* Make sure that empty values are not pushed to the array.

* Once the value has been added to the array, clear the input field and re-render the todo list.
