## Interview Questions

* [Glassdoor Interview Questions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/junior-web-developer-interview-questions-SRCH_KO0,20.htm) and [Glassdoor Junior Developer Questions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/junior-developer-interview-questions-SRCH_KO0,16.htm)
  
  * Series of questions assumably asked by interviewers to interviewees for junior web developer and junior developer positions. Many of them have answers, but I think the answers are not adequate most of the time.
  
  * Pros
    
    * Free.
    
    * Tons of questions asked by real companies (assumably).
    
    * Can especially help if applying to a company that is listed.
    
    * Includes hard questions (algorithms) and soft questions (personality).
  
  * Cons
    
    * Answers can be inadequate or wrong.
    
    * Questions are not comprehensive, nor are they necessarily truthful. This is based on interviewees sharing info on their own volition, so questions may change. 
  
  * Who is it for?
    
    * Students that would like to prepare for interviews, but are self-sufficient enough to find answers on their own. Not comprehensive, but great if used in conjunction with algorithm-based interview prep like FreeCodeCamp. 

* [Quora * Developer Questions](https://www.quora.com/What-interview-questions-should-I-ask-a-junior-web-developer)
  
  * Q & A of how to determine a good candidate. Answers are all from employers, Hiring Engineers, and HR.  
  
  * Pros
    
  	  * Free.
    
  	  * Variety of different answers, so gives a decent landscape for what different employers might be looking for. 
  
  * Cons
    
   	 * Actual resource links are in each answer.
    
   	 * Small sample size, but this can be offset by a number of votes each answer receives.
    
 	   * Less about technical aspect than the behavioral.
  
  * Who is it good for?
    
  	  * Potential junior devs may find these to be insightful since many employers seem to be looking for desire and willingness to learn rather than technical knowledge.
