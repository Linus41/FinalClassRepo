Instructions:

```js
const stuff = [10,34,56,67,93,120,137,168,259,280,311,342,413,514];

const randomValue = stuff[ Math.floor( Math.random() * 14 ) ];
```

Write a for loop that looks at each index of the array to see if it matches the random value

If it does match the random value alert/log (depending if you are running this in chrome or w/ Node) out the index of the array and the value.
