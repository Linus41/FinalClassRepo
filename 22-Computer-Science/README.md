# Unit 22: Computer Science

## Overview
This week's lesson plans will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and terminology of computer science. The intent is to provide you with just enough exposure to contextualize technical interview questions and enable further study. We intentionally omit rigorous exercises to allow you to focus on projects.

## Key Topics
* Benchmarks
* Binary search
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Quick sort
* Lodash
* Big O
* Data structures
  * Arrays
  * Linked lists
  * Maps
  * Objects
  * Stacks and queues

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is Lodash?
2. Can you describe how stacks and queues work?
3. What is Big O notation?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Explain what benchmarks are used for and why they are useful
* Provide a real world example of stacks and queues in an application
* Draw a diagram of a linked list
* Give an example of a binary search tree
* Explain what Big O notation is used for
* Explain what a selection sort is used for
