# First Mock

In this activity you will add code to spy on the `console.log` method.

## Instructions

* Take a moment to examine the `Unsolved/child.js` and `Unsolved/dayCare.js` files. They should be almost identical to the previous example, but with a few `console.log`s added to the code.

* Add code to spy on the `console.log` method to ensure that it is called when expected with the correct arguments.

## ðŸ’¡ Hint(s)

* Use the previous demonstration as a reference for setting up mocks and spies.
