# TDD

In this activity you will write tests outlining the expected functionality for application code that haven't been implemented yet.

## Instructions

* Open the `algo.js` file and take a moment to examine the code.
  
  * The `Algo` constructor function has three empty methods: `reverse`, `isPalindrome`, and `capitalize`.

* Now open the `test/algo.test.js` file.

  * This file contains `describe` blocks for each method on the `Algo` constructor.

* Write code to test each method:

  * The `reverse` method should take a string as an argument and return a new reversed version of the string. e.g. "Hello" should return "elloH".

  * The `isPalindrome` method should take a string as an argument and return the boolean `true` if the provided string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is the same backwards as it is forwards, e.g. "racecar". Return `false` is the string is not a palindrome.

  * The `capitalize` method should take a string as an argument and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized. e.g. "hello world!" should return "Hello World!".

* **Important**: Write code for the tests only, the only file you will be modifying is `tests/algo.test.js`. Initially all of your tests will fail since these methods are empty, but using the tests you can define how each method _should_ work.

## ðŸ’¡ Hint(s)

* Use the previous example as a reference.
