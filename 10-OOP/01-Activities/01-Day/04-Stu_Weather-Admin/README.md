# Weather Admin

In this activity you will create and fix a CLI based weather application that will give updates about the weather at the searched location.

## Instructions

* There are two ways to run this app: as a user or as an administrator. To run as admin, type `node CLI.js admin` To run as a user, type `node CLI.js user bob "los angeles, ca"`, where the user mode must provide a name and a location as additional arguments.

* Ideally, users can search for weather data about a location. Every time they search, the place and time get saved to a text file. So when the app is run as admin, the admin user can see a history of all searches.

* Unfortunately, this app is also broken. Try to run it as either a user or admin and fix the actual errors that appear in the console and then any "logic" errors that prevent the expected behavior.
