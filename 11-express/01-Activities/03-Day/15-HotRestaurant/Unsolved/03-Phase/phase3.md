## Phase III - For this third phase, aim to complete the following

* Backend Team:

Create a set of variables (hint: arrays of objects) for holding the reservation and waitlist data

Create a set of routes that then display this data as JSONs. 

Users should be given these JSONs if they visit the appropriate page (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/api/tables they should see a JSON of table data).

* Frontend Team:

Temporarily join the backend team. 

Your task will be to create Express routes that display your HTML pages when a user visits the appropriate page. (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/tables... they should be shown the table.html page.)

If you finish early begin creating the code necessary to convert your form data into JSON objects.
