# Unit 11: Express

## Overview
In this unit, we will create our own server-side APIs using the Express.js framework. Express is the most widely used Node.js server framework. It will allow us to quickly and easily establish our API routes and associated HTTP request methods.

Routing is how we design our server to handle responses when a client makes a request at a specific endpoint, or URL. We learned how to make GET requests from the client-side in a previous unit. Now we will learn how those requests are handled on the server-side. Our server will _listen_ for a specific type of request at a specific endpoint and when it _hears_ that request, it will respond accordingly.

We will also learn the HTTP POST request method to submit data to our server.

## Key Topics
* http
* Express.js
* Routing
* Postman
* HTTP POST requests
* Express.static()

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is routing?
2. How does the request-response pattern work?
3. What is sent when a client makes a POST request?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests
* Configure an Express.js app to serve static files
* Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses
* Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes
* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server
* Explain and configure middleware to extend the functionality of Express.js
