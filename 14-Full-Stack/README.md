# Unit 14: Full-Stack

## Overview
In the previous unit, we modularized our applications following the MVC paradigm and integrated a custom ORM into the Model layer. Like all things in software development, when we find ourselves repeating a task, we look for programmatic solutions. Because the implementation of object-relational mapping is a common task in full-stack web development, third-party libraries emerged to do the heavy-lifting for us. In this unit we will integrate Sequelize, a popular Node.js ORM, into our newly modularized applications.

## Key Topics
* Sequelize
* sequelize-cli
* CRUD
* Models
* Validations
* Associations

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is a Model? 
2. What are two approaches to using Sequelize in a full-stack web application? 
3. How does one perform joins using Sequelize?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Configure a full-stack web application to use the Sequelize ORM library
* Define models that POST data using validations
* Define models that GET data using validations
* Implement CRUD methods using Sequelize
* Implement Sequelize associations to join one or more tables
* Configure Heroku for deployment of an application using Sequelize

## Homework: Reverse Engineer
* In this assignment, you will reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose.
