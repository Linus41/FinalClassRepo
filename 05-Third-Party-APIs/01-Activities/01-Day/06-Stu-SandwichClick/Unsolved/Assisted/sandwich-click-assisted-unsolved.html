    // This document.ready isn't necessary in this example... but is needed in cases where the HTML is complex.

      // VARIABLES
      // ====================================================================
      // Here we create variables for tracking the number of sandwiches eaten

      // 1. Create a counter variable to hold the current number of PBJs eaten. 
      // 2. Create a counter variable to hold the current number of Grilled Cheeses eaten. 
      // 3. Create a counter variable to hold the current number of Roast Beefs eaten.


      // FUNCTIONS
      // ====================================================================
      // Here we create various on "click" functions which capture the clicks
      // Inside each click event is the code to create an alert, update the counter, then show the updated count.

      // 4. Create an on click for PBJ, so that when someone clicks on the h3 with id='pbj', the PBJ counter increments up, and an alert or log is thrown telling
      // us how many PBJ have been eaten.

      // 5. Do the same as above for Grilled Cheese and Roast Beef.
